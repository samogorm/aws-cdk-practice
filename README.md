# AWS CDK Practice

This repo contains code where I've been practising AWS services, more specifically:

- CDK
- Lambda
- API Gateway

As such, you probably won't see any TDD here!

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
